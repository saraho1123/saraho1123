## Hi there! I'm Sarah Osgood.

### Frontend engineer currently residing in Fort Collins, Colorado.

😎

- 🔭  I’m currently in a fully immersive program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.io/), slotted to graduate in March 2021.
- 🌱 My studies are focused in `React`, `JavaScript`, `Node JS`, `TypeScript` `Test Driven Develepment`, and `SASS`.

- 🧳  My background is in education, but not always in the traditional ways:
  - Mountaineering/Climbing Instructor.
  - Teaching English in Asia.
  - Teaching at an alternative middle and highschool for at-risk youth.
  - I've also taught preschool and K-12.
  
- ⚡  What I do besides code:
  - Camping/hiking/backpacking 🥾 ⛺️
  - Rock climbing 🧗‍♀️
  - Road trips 🏞
  - Travel (hopefully again after we get through COVID!) 🗺
